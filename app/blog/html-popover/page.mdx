As of January 2025, the HTML `popover` element has finally reached Baseline "Newly Available" status. This means that the feature is now available in all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Therefor, I think it's time to take a closer look at how to use the `popover` element in your projects.

## Basic Usage

All you need are two elements to create a popover: a <i>trigger</i> element and a <i>content</i> element.

The trigger element is the element that the user interacts with to show the popover, such as a button or link. The content element is the element that contains the popover content.


<CodeBlock
    language="html"
    code={`
<button popovertarget="my-popover">Open Popover</button>

<div id="my-popover" popover>
   This works without any JavaScript!
</div>
`}
/>

It's as simple as this! But for many years, developers had to rely on JavaScript libraries or custom implementations to create popovers.

I'm happy to see this feature finally being available natively in all Baseline-supported browsers.

export default function Page({ children }) {
  return (
    <MdxLayout metadata={metadata} slug={HTML_POPOVER.slug}>
      {children}
    </MdxLayout>
  );
