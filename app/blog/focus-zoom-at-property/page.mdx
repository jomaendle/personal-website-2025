  This demo is based on the great work of [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev/) in his talk about the [Symphony of the Web](https://youtu.be/VQfL3Egin7s?si=RayfuhaUKKBVrhtO&t=887).
  Thanks for the inspiration, Adam!

## How It Works

The dynamic focus zoom effect is created using CSS custom properties and a `radial-gradient` mask. By updating these properties based on mouse movement, we simulate a spotlight effect that follows the cursor.

<CodeBlock language="css" code={`
.focus-zoom {
    @property --focal-size {
      syntax: '<length-percentage>';
      initial-value: 100%;
      inherits: false;
    }

    mask-image: radial-gradient(
      circle at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),
      transparent var(--focal-size),
      black 0%
    );
}`} />

First, we define the `--focal-size` `@property` rule, which controls the size of the spotlight effect. This allows for smooth transitions when changing the spotlight size.

Then, we use the `mask-image` property to create a radial gradient mask. The gradient is centered at the mouse position and transitions from `transparent` to `black`.

The mouse position is set using the `--mouse-x` and `--mouse-y` custom properties, which are updated using JavaScript.


## Interactivity

We want to update the spotlight effect based on the mouse position, so we listen for `pointermove` events and update the `--mouse-x` and `--mouse-y` properties accordingly.

In order to activate the spotlight effect, we toggle the `--focal-size` property between `7vmax` and `100%`, whenever the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key is pressed.


<CodeBlock language="js" code={`

// Toggle the spotlight effect
const toggleSpotlight = (toggle: boolean) =>
    spotlightRef.current?.style.setProperty(
        "--focal-size",
        toggle ? "7vmax" : "100%",
    );

// Listen for pointermove events and update the custom properties
window.addEventListener("pointermove", (e) => {
    spotlightRef.current?.style.setProperty("--mouse-x", e.clientX + "px");
    spotlightRef.current?.style.setProperty("--mouse-y", e.clientY + "px");
});

window.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => toggleSpotlight(e.altKey));
window.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => toggleSpotlight(e.altKey));
window.addEventListener("touchstart", (e) => toggleSpotlight(true));
window.addEventListener("touchend", (e) => toggleSpotlight(false));
`} />


## Transitioning between states

In our transition, we target our `--focal-size` property and use the new `linear` timing function, which allows to generate spring-like easing curves.

  Spring easing curves are a great way to create more natural and organic animations.

I've created the one I use in this demo using [this website from Kevin Grajeda](https://www.kvin.me/css-springs).

<CodeBlock language="css" code={`
.focus-zoom {
      ...

      transition: --focal-size .7s linear(0, 0.0021, 0.0083 1.06%, 0.0317 2.12%, 0.071 3.27%, 0.1307 4.59%, 0.259 6.89%, 0.5489 11.48%, 0.6704 13.51%, 0.7885 15.72%, 0.8812, 0.9572 19.78%, 0.9902, 1.0187, 1.0429, 1.063, 1.0793 25.08%, 1.0929 26.23%, 1.105 27.73%, 1.1116 29.32%, 1.113 30.99%, 1.109 32.85%, 1.1026 34.35%, 1.0926 36.12%, 1.0397 43.71%, 1.017 47.6%, 1.0073 49.72%, 0.9995, 0.9938 54.13%, 0.9898 56.51%, 0.9876 59.34%, 0.9874 62.52%, 0.9999 82.12%, 1.0014 89.54%, 1.0009 99.96%);
}
`} />

And that's it! Once again, thanks to Adam Argyle for the inspiration and the great talk.

I learned a lot from this project and I hope you did too! Especially working with `mask-image` combined with `@property` was a new experience for me.
