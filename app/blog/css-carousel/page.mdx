The CSS Overflow Module Level 5 introduces two powerful new features for scrollable containers: `::scroll-buttons` and `::scroll-markers`.

These features enable native, customizable scroll controls and indicators, making it easier to build accessible, visually consistent carousels and scrollers without JavaScript.

## What Are Scroll-Buttons?
Scroll-buttons are interactive elements rendered by the browser at the edges of a scrollable container. They allow users to scroll the content by clicking or tapping, and can be styled with CSS.

<b>Key features:</b>
- Appear at the start/end of a scrollable axis.
- Can be styled and positioned using new pseudo-elements like `::scroll-button(inline-start)` and `::scroll-button(inline-end)`.
- Support for custom content via the content property.

## What Are Scroll-Markers?
Scroll-markers are visual indicators that represent scroll positions or items within a scrollable container. They help users understand their position within the scroll area.

<b>Key features:</b>
- Rendered for each scroll-snap point or item.
- Can be styled with `::scroll-marker` and grouped with `::scroll-marker-group`.
- The `:target-current` pseudo-class highlights the marker for the currently visible item.
