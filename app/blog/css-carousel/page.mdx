The CSS Overflow Module Level 5 introduces two powerful new features for scrollable containers: `::scroll-buttons` and `::scroll-markers`.

These features enable native, customizable scroll controls and indicators, making it easier to build accessible, visually consistent carousels and scrollers without JavaScript.

> **Note:** As of now, browser support for these features is limited. Check the Baseline status below for the latest updates.

## What Are Scroll-Buttons?
Scroll-buttons are interactive elements rendered by the browser at the edges of a scrollable container. They allow users to scroll the content by clicking or tapping, and can be styled with CSS.

<b>Key features:</b>
- Appear at the start/end of a scrollable axis.
- Can be styled and positioned using new pseudo-elements like `::scroll-button(inline-start)` and `::scroll-button(inline-end)`.
- Support for custom content via the content property.

## What Are Scroll-Markers?
Scroll-markers are visual indicators that represent scroll positions or items within a scrollable container. They help users understand their position within the scroll area.

<b>Key features:</b>
- Rendered for each scroll-snap point or item.
- Can be styled with `::scroll-marker` and grouped with `::scroll-marker-group`.
- The `:target-current` pseudo-class highlights the marker for the currently visible item.

## Minimal Working Example

<div className="absolute left-0 right-0 p-4 max-w-4xl xl:max-w-5xl min-h-[320px] mx-auto w-full z-50">
  <CarouselCode />
</div>

<div className="w-full h-[320px]"></div>


## Conclusion
With the new `::scroll-buttons` and `::scroll-markers` features, you can create carousels and scrollers that are not only visually appealing but also accessible to all users.
And the best part, you can do it all with just CSS!
No tedious JavaScript or 3rd-party libraries are needed.
