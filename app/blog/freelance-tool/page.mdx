As a part-time freelancer, I was looking for a simple tool to manage my work.

I needed something that could track different clients, tasks, time spent on each project and generate invoices.

I couldn't find a tool that did all these things in a simple way without spending too much money.

So I decided to <del>build</del> vibe-code my own tool.

## The process

1. I started a new project in [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)

2. Outlined my specific requirements. In this case, I needed:
   - Dashboard to track my clients and projects
   - A way to log time spent on each project
   - Simple invoice generator

3. Refined the product through multiple iterations. I revised the design and functionality based on my needs.

4. Integrated Supabase for authentication and data storage

## The Result
My very own software tool to efficiently manage my work with a neat dashboard to keep track of everything.

It took me about one hour to build the tool until it was fully functional.

To use it, I linked the tool to my personal domain and set up a simple authentication system with Supabase.

The cost to build and run the tool is literally 0â‚¬.

Check it out in the video below:

## Notes

I don't plan to share the actual tool for the following reasons:
- It's not a product, just a personal tool
- Except for basic authentication, it doesn't have any security features
- I don't want to maintain it for others

## Final Thoughts

Custom software is becoming ubiquitous. I highly encourage you to try it out yourself and built software that truly fits your needs.

If you're in need for a new tool but don't feel comfortable building it yourself, feel free to reach out to me.

I'll be happy to help you out.
