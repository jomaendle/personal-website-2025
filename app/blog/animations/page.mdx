Have you ever tried to animate a background in CSS with a linear-gradient? If so, then you most likely stumbled upon the same issue as I did.

The following code showâ€™s the most simple approach I would start with, when it comes to animate the background.

<CodeBlock language="css" code={`
body {
      margin: 0;
      height: 100vh;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      animation: animate-bg 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes animate-bg {
    from {
        background: linear-gradient(yellow, dodgerblue);
    }
    to {
        background: linear-gradient(dodgerblue, yellow);
    }
}
`}/>

We define an animation on the body element which changes the gradient background from black-white to white-black.

However, we can see that it doesnâ€™t work as expected. The color changes immediately, without any animation or smooth transition.

/>

## How to solve it

Some solutions to this are animating the `background-position` which generates the same effect. We can see it in the following code:

<CodeBlock language="css" code={`
body {
      background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #EA225E, #C22286, #612E8D);
      background-size: 200% 200%;
      animation: GradientBackground 10s ease infinite;
}

@keyframes GradientBackground {
    0%, 100% {
        background-position: 0% 50%;
    }
    50% {
        background-position: 100% 50%;
    }
};
`}/>

However, it somehow feels hacky to me, as we need to define an extra large background of which we then animate a changing position. Why canâ€™t we just flip the colors of the gradient?

## A better approach â€” using modern CSS @property

With the release of the CSS Properties and Values API, we actually can do this! This API exposes low-level functionality of the CSS rendering engine, enabling developers with more powerful styling.

In our case, we define a new CSS Custom Property. However, we use the @property syntax to declare it.

By setting the syntax property, we can specify the exact type of property, such as `color`, `number`, `length`, and many more.

<CodeBlock
    language="css"
    code={`
@property --gradPoint {
    syntax: '<percentage>';
    inherits: false;
    initial-value: 0%;
}
`}
/>

Instead of changing the background property in our animation, we change the value of the colors of it. To make it work, we define two color variables using the `@property` syntax.

Then, we define an animation which changes their color from black to white and vice versa.

Finally, we apply this animation to our body element.

<CodeBlock language="css" code={`
body {
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    animation: animate-color 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
    background: linear-gradient(var(--color), var(--color-second));
}

@keyframes animate-color {
    to {
        --color-1: yellow;
        --color-2: dodgerblue;
    }
}

@property --color {
    syntax: '<color>';
    inherits: false;
    initial-value: red;
}

@property --color-second {
    syntax: '<color>';
    inherits: false;
    initial-value: blue;
}
`}/>

## And this is what we get

<BlogVideo
    src="/animations/2.mp4"
    caption=" Figure 2: A smooth transition between the colors of the gradient"
/>

A smooth transition between the color changes ðŸŽ‰

export default function Page({children}) {
    return (
    <MdxLayout metadata={metadata} slug="animations">
        {children}
    </MdxLayout>
)


}
