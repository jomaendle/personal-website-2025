Working with Claude Code becomes exponentially more powerful when you leverage **hooks**—automated commands that run at specific points in your workflow. This guide covers the essential hooks and automation strategies I use daily to stay productive and get notified when tasks complete.

## What Are Claude Code Hooks?

Hooks are shell commands that execute automatically during Claude Code's lifecycle. Think of them as event listeners for your AI coding workflow—you define what happens when files are edited, tasks complete, or specific tools are used.

They're configured in `.claude/settings.json` and give you complete control over your development workflow.

### The 3 Essential Hook Events

For most developers, these three hooks cover 90% of productivity needs:

1. **PostEdit** - Runs after Claude edits any file (perfect for auto-formatting)
2. **Stop** - Runs when a complete task finishes (ideal for notifications and final checks)
3. **PostWrite** - Runs after Claude creates new files (great for security scanning)

## Essential Hooks Every Developer Should Use

### 1. Desktop Notifications (macOS)

Never miss when a task completes. This hook uses `osascript` to show a native macOS notification with sound:

<CodeBlock language="json" code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": {
      "command": "osascript -e 'display notification \\"Claude Code task completed\\" with title \\"AI Development\\" sound name \\"Glass\\"'",
      "description": "Notify when task completes"
    }
  }
}`}/>

> **What is osascript?**
> `osascript` is macOS's built-in command-line tool for running AppleScript. It lets you control macOS apps, show notifications, display dialogs, and automate system tasks—all from the terminal. No installation needed!
> **Windows/Linux alternatives:** `notify-send` (Linux), `msg` or PowerShell's `New-BurntToastNotification` (Windows)

**Why this is game-changing:** Start a complex refactoring, switch to another task, and get notified when Claude finishes. Perfect for long-running operations.

### 2. Auto-Format on Every Edit

Ensure consistent code style across your entire project:

<CodeBlock language="json" code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "PostEdit": {
      "command": "prettier --write {{file_path}} && eslint --fix {{file_path}}",
      "description": "Auto-format and lint"
    }
  }
}`}/>

**Result:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted. Zero configuration drift, zero manual cleanup.

### 3. Security Scanning on New Files

Prevent secrets and vulnerabilities from being committed:

<CodeBlock language="json" code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "PostWrite": {
      "command": "git secrets --scan {{file_path}} || echo 'Warning: Potential secret detected!'",
      "description": "Scan for leaked secrets"
    }
  }
}`}/>

**Result:** Catch API keys, tokens, and credentials before they reach your repository.



## Advanced Automation: Keep Your CLAUDE.MD Up to Date

The `CLAUDE.MD` file is your project's instruction manual for AI assistants. Keeping it current is crucial but easy to forget. Here are two approaches to automate it:

### Approach 1: Hook-Based CLAUDE.MD Updater

This hook reminds you to update `CLAUDE.MD` after task completion:

<CodeBlock language="json" code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": {
      "command": "echo '\\n📝 Reminder: Update CLAUDE.MD if project structure changed\\nRun: claude update-docs' && git diff --stat HEAD~5 | grep -E 'src/|components/|lib/' && echo '\\n⚠️  Core files changed - CLAUDE.MD update recommended!'",
      "description": "Check if CLAUDE.MD needs updating"
    }
  }
}`}/>

**How it works:** After each task, it checks recent changes to core directories and reminds you if documentation should be updated.

**Pro tip:** Create a custom alias to make updates easy:
<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`alias update-docs="claude 'Analyze recent changes and update CLAUDE.MD with new architecture details'"`}/>

### Approach 2: Scheduled GitHub Action

For teams or active projects, automate CLAUDE.MD updates weekly with GitHub Actions:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" code={`name: Update CLAUDE.MD
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 9 AM
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggers

jobs:
  update-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for analysis

      - name: Analyze changes and update CLAUDE.MD
        run: |
          # Get changes from last week
          git log --since="7 days ago" --name-status --pretty=format:"" | \
          grep -E "^[AM].*\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$" > recent_changes.txt

          # Count significant changes
          CHANGE_COUNT=$(wc -l < recent_changes.txt)

          if [ $CHANGE_COUNT -gt 10 ]; then
            echo "📊 $CHANGE_COUNT files changed this week"
            echo "Consider updating CLAUDE.MD to reflect:"
            cat recent_changes.txt
            # Optionally: Create an issue or PR
          fi

      - name: Create update reminder issue
        if: env.CHANGE_COUNT > 10
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: '📝 CLAUDE.MD Update Recommended',
              body: 'Significant changes detected this week. Review and update project documentation.'
            });
`}/>

**What this does:** Every Monday, it analyzes the past week's changes and creates a GitHub issue if significant updates were made, ensuring your documentation never falls out of date.

## Quick Tips for Hook Power Users

### Combining Multiple Hooks
You can define multiple hooks for the same event by chaining commands with `&&`:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`"command": "prettier --write {{file_path}} && eslint --fix {{file_path}} && git add {{file_path}}"`}/>

### Debugging Hook Failures
If a hook isn't working:
1. Check `.claude/settings.json` syntax (valid JSON required)
2. Test the command manually in your terminal
3. Use `echo` statements to verify variables: `echo "File: {{file_path}}"`
4. Check Claude Code's output—hook errors are displayed inline

### Platform-Specific Hooks
Use conditional commands for cross-platform compatibility:

<CodeBlock language="json" code={`{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": {
      "command": "if [[ $OSTYPE == 'darwin'* ]]; then osascript -e 'display notification \\"Done\\"'; else notify-send 'Done'; fi",
      "description": "Cross-platform notifications"
    }
  }
}`}/>

### Hook Variables You Can Use
- `{{file_path}}` - Full path to the file being processed
- `{{tool_name}}` - Name of the tool being used (Write, Edit, Read, etc.)
- `{{project_root}}` - Root directory of your project

**Pro Tip:** Start with one hook (I recommend the notification hook), use it for a week, then add more. Hooks work best when they become invisible parts of your workflow.
