In this article, I'm rebuilding the animated sign-up button Emil Kowalski's [Animations on the Web](https://animations.dev/) course.

<BlogVideo src="/animated-sign-up-button/tease.mp4" caption="Figure 1: The animated sign-up button in action." className="max-w-[340px]" />

The first time I saw this animation, I truly felt inspired.

The animation sticks to the button itself, not affecting the layout of the page. It's a great example of how animations can enhance user experience without being intrusive.

Now let's dive into building this button.

## Button Structure

Our animation is built with React and <s>Framer Motion</s> [Motion](https://motion.dev/), a library that makes it easy to create animations in React applications.

The button has three different states, which are reflected by the changing content of the button: `idle`, `loading` and `success`

So, our basic structure withouth any animations would look like this:

<CodeBlock language="jsx" code={`
type ButtonState = "idle" | "loading" | "success";

export const AnimatedSignUpButton = () => {
    const [buttonState, setButtonState] = useState<ButtonState>("idle");

    const buttonStates: {
        [key in ButtonState]: string | JSX.Element;
    } = {
        idle: "Sign up for newsletter",
        loading: (
            <div className="size-4 animate-spin">
                <Loader2 className={styles.icon} />
            </div>
        ),
        success: "Thank you!",
    }

    return (
        <button>
            {buttonStates[buttonState]}
        </button>
    );
}
`}/>

## Handle state changes

In order to change the content of the button, we add a click listener and a `handleSubmit` function.

This function changes the state from `idle` to `loading` and then to `success` after a short delay.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" code={`

    const handleSubmit = () => {
        if (buttonState !== "idle") {
            return;
        }

        setButtonState("loading");

        setTimeout(() => {
            setButtonState("success");
        }, 2000);

        setTimeout(() => {
            setButtonState("idle");
        }, 4000);
    };

...
    <button  onClick={handleSubmit}>
...
`} />

## Adding Animations

Next, we need to import the    `motion` object from `framer-motion`.

Inside our button, we wrap the content in a `motion.span` component. This component will be animated by Motion.

We can then add animations to the button by setting the `initial`, `animate`, `exit` and `transition` properties.

To ensure that Motion knows when to animate the button, we need to add a `key` property to the button. This property should be unique for each state.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" code={`
<button className={styles.button} onClick={handleSubmit}>
    <AnimatePresence mode="popLayout" initial={false}>
        <motion.span
            className={styles.span}
            key={buttonState}
            transition={{
              type: "spring",
              duration,
              bounce,
            }}
            initial={{
              opacity: 0,
              y: -25,
            }}
            animate={{
              opacity: 1,
              y: 0,
            }}
            exit={{
              opacity: 0,
              y: 25,
            }}
            >
              {buttonStates[buttonState]}
        </motion.span>
    </AnimatePresence>
</button>
`} />

And that's it! We've created a beautiful animated sign-up button ðŸŽ‰.

## Playground

Here you can play around with the button and see how it behaves in different states. Drag the Duration and Bounce sliders to see how the animation changes.

<AnimatedSignUpButton/>


export default function Page({children}) {
    return (
        <MdxLayout metadata={metadata} slug={ANIMATED_SIGN_UP_BUTTON.slug}>
            {children}
        </MdxLayout>
    )
}
