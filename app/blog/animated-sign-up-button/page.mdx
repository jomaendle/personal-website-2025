In this article, I'm rebuilding the animated sign-up button I've encountered in Emil Kowalski's [Animations on the Web](https://animations.dev/) course.

<BlogVideo src="/animated-sign-up-button/tease.mp4" caption="Figure 1: The animated sign-up button in action." className="max-w-[350px] h-[280px] sm:h-[260px] sm:max-w-[420px]" />

The first time I saw this animation, I truly felt inspired.

The animation sticks to the button itself, not affecting the layout of the page. It's a great example of how animations can enhance user experience without being intrusive.

Now let's dive into building this button.

## Button Structure

Our animation is built with React and <s>Framer Motion</s> [Motion](https://motion.dev/), a library that makes it easy to create animations in Web applications, especially with React.

The button has three different states, which are reflected by the changing content of the button: `idle`, `loading` and `success`

So, our basic structure without any animations would look like this:

<CodeBlock language="tsx" code={`
type ButtonState = "idle" | "loading" | "success";

export const AnimatedSignUpButton = () => {
    const [buttonState, setButtonState] = useState<ButtonState>("idle");

    const buttonStates: {
        [key in ButtonState]: string | JSX.Element;
    } = {
        idle: "Sign up for newsletter",
        loading: (
            <div className="size-4 animate-spin">
                <Loader2 className={styles.icon} />
            </div>
        ),
        success: "Thank you!",
    }

    return (
        <button>
            {buttonStates[buttonState]}
        </button>
    );
}
`}/>

## Handle state changes

In order to change the content of the button, we add a click listener and a `handleSubmit` function.

This function changes the state from `idle` to `loading` and then to `success` after a short delay.

<CodeBlock language="tsx" code={`

const handleSubmit = () => {
    if (buttonState !== "idle") {
        return;
    }

    setButtonState("loading");

    setTimeout(() => {
        setButtonState("success");
    }, 2000);

    setTimeout(() => {
        setButtonState("idle");
    }, 4000);
};

return (
    <button onClick={handleSubmit}>
        {buttonStates[buttonState]}
    </button>
);
`} />

## Adding Animations

Next, we need to import the `motion` object from `framer-motion`.

Inside our button, we wrap the content in a `motion.span` component. This tells Motion that we want to animate this element.

We can then add animations to the button by setting the `initial`, `animate`, `exit` and `transition` properties. In our case, we want the elements to slide in from the top and slide out to the bottom.

To ensure that Motion triggers the animation when the button state changes, we need to add a `key` property to the `motion.span` component. This property should be unique for each state.

<CodeBlock language="tsx" code={`
<button className={styles.button} onClick={handleSubmit}>
    <AnimatePresence mode="popLayout" initial={false}>
        <motion.span
            className={styles.span}
            key={buttonState}
            transition={{
              type: "spring",
              duration,
              bounce,
            }}
            initial={{
              opacity: 0,
              y: -25,
            }}
            animate={{
              opacity: 1,
              y: 0,
            }}
            exit={{
              opacity: 0,
              y: 25,
            }}
            >
              {buttonStates[buttonState]}
        </motion.span>
    </AnimatePresence>
</button>
`} />

And that's it! We've created a beautiful animated sign-up button ðŸŽ‰.

## Playground

Here you can play around with the button and see how it behaves in different states. Drag the Duration and Bounce sliders to see how the animation changes.

<AnimatedSignUpButton/>


export default function Page({children}) {
    return (
        <MdxLayout metadata={metadata} slug={ANIMATED_SIGN_UP_BUTTON.slug}>
            {children}
        </MdxLayout>
    )
}
