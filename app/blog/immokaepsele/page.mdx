This post is not going to be about a new CSS feature, but about my work I did recently for [ImmoKÃ¤psele](https://immokaepsele.de/), a real estate company in Germany.

I want to share my experience and the process I went through to create a new website for them.

## The Challenge

- Moving from WordPress to a modern tech stack
- Improving performance and user experience
- Giving the client the possibility to manage their properties via their CMS (Flowfact) and then showing them on the website. Previously there was a WordPress Plugin for that, but now the page is built with Next.js and Flowfact API.
- The client wanted to have a modern-looking website that is easy to use and navigate.

The challenge here was to rebuild their existing WordPress website with a modern tech stack, while making it more performant, modern-looking and user-friendly.
