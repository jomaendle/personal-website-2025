This post is not going to be about a new CSS feature, but about my work I did recently for [ImmoKÃ¤psele](https://immokaepsele.de/), a real estate company in Germany.

I want to share my experience and the process I went through to create a new website for them.

## The Challenge

- Moving from WordPress to a modern tech stack
- Improving performance and user experience
- Giving the client the possibility to manage their properties via their CMS (Flowfact) and then showing them on the website. Previously there was a WordPress Plugin for that, but now the page is built with Next.js and Flowfact API.
- Having a Lead magnet for the client to get in touch with potential customers, via a property evaluation form.
- The client wanted to have a modern-looking website that is easy to use and navigate.


When ImmoKÃ¤psele approached me for a website redesign, they faced challenges common to many businesses with aging web platforms. Their WordPress site was functional but couldn't deliver the performance or user experience needed in today's digital real estate market. This project wasn't just about a visual refreshâ€”it represented a comprehensive digital transformation.
